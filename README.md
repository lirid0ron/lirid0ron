### Hi there, I'm Liri! 👋

[cite_start]I'm a Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology and a selective Break Through Tech AI/ML Fellow[cite: 48], driven to build what’s next in artificial intelligence and game development. [cite_start]My passion is for the entire development lifecycle—from architecting a curriculum for young learners [cite: 61] [cite_start]and engineering full-stack developer tools in Electron [cite: 70][cite_start], to scripting immersive gameplay [cite: 71] and building predictive models with Python and Keras.

When I'm not coding, you can find me crafting a witty Letterboxd review, curating an oddly specific playlist, or perfecting my banana bread recipe (which, I've discovered, is a lot like debugging, just with more edible results).
